## Debug Keys

To activate the in-game debug keys type `kapura` (must be the first thing typed unless the <kbd>Insert</kbd> key is pressed to reset). This will reveal the FPS counter and enable several debug keys.

| <kbd>2</kbd> | Show grid                      |
| <kbd>8</kbd> | Reload scene                   |
| <kbd>+</kbd> | Mute sound                     |
